       "'\\nONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were— Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.\\n\\nThey lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree.\\n\\n\"NOW, my dears,\" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, \"you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don\\'t go into Mr. McGregor\\'s garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"\\n\\n\"NOW run along, and don\\'t get into mischief. I am going out.\"\\n\\nTHEN old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, to the baker\\'s. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.\\n\\nFLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries;\\n\\nBUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor\\'s garden and squeezed under the gate!\\n\\nPeter Rabbit Eating Carrots\\nPeter Rabbit Eating Carrots\\nFIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;\\n\\nAND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.\\n\\nBUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!\\n\\nMR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, \"Stop thief!\"\\n\\nPETER was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.\\n\\nHe lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.\\n\\nAFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.\\n\\nPeter Rabbit stuck in the gooseberry net\\nStuck in the Gooseberry Net\\nPETER gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.\\n\\nMR. McGREGOR came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.\\n\\nAND rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.\\n\\nMR. McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.\\n\\nPresently Peter sneezed— \"Kertyschoo!\" Mr. McGregor was after him in no time,\\n\\nAND tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter.
